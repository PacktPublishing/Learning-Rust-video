## About the Video Course
Blockchain disrupts many different aspects of our life including finance, retail, merchandising, identity, and more. Ethereum is a platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. This is the perfect guide to help you learn the basics of building decentralized applications with the Ethereum network. You’ll learn the core concepts of decentralized applications as we build an online marketplace, connecting buyers and sellers together to exchange goods and services. In doing so, you’ll deploy your code to the Ethereum network, and build a user Interface to expose your decentralized application to the world.

The focus of this course is learning blockchain and using it for application development by building applications, where each application should do something useful. You’ll learn how to create smart contracts, implement business logic using Solidity, and test your code. By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills necessary to build, test, and deploy applications in the Ethereum network. You’ll also have a solid understanding of blockchain application development, with skills that readily transfer to application development on other blockchains such as NEO, EOS, Cardano, and more.
